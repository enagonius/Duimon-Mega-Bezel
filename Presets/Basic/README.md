### **Basic Presets.**

Basic presets use the "MBZ__4__BASIC__GDV.slangp" or the "MBZ__4__BASIC__LCD-GRID.slangp" base preset. These presets share a subset of features with the Standard base presets and require a more modest PC. They are essentially overlays with a reflection.

The "MBZ__4" designation places them lowest on the list for PC requirements.

```dos
